The dataset consists of 943,672 stock-market-related tweets collected between April 9 and July 16, 2020, covering major market events during the COVID-19 period.
From the large dataset, a random sample of 5,000 tweets was extracted to create a manageable dataset for text processing and model development.
Out of these, 1,300 tweets were manually annotated into three sentiment classes: positive, neutral, and negative, enabling supervised machine-learning tasks.
The dataset is highly suitable for sentiment analysis, NLP preprocessing research, and training classification models for market-related social media text.
The manually labeled subset also helps in evaluating model accuracy, especially for tasks involving noise, sarcasm, or financial jargon present in tweets.
